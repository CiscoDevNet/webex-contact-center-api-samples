## Getting Started

This video doesn't necessarily need any additional setup as it is demonstrated using Postman.

Keep in mind that you still need to have your Postman setup with your authorization or at least using an unexpired Access Token to run this API.

### If you want to use the frontEnd javascript code:

**Step 1:**

- Copy all the content of the file _**ewt_frontend_form.js**_ into your Javascript Injector of choice.
